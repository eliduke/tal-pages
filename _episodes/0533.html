title: It's Not the Product, It's the Person
description: >
  Starting a business is not for the self-doubting. Or even usually the self-deprecating. The first thing you have to sell is yourself â€” like dating, but with a greater chance of landing in debt. Alex Blumberg tells the incredible, sweat-stains-and-all saga of a man fumbling through starting a new business, and the man is: himself. Plus, new stories from Mike Birbiglia and Love + Radio.
