  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>I really enjoy <i><a href="https://thisamericanlife.org" target="_blank">This American Life</a></i> (duh), and many years ago I got excited about creating my own little archive in rebellion against the iTunes podcast subscription service at the time. I was a budding web developer and hungry for personal projects that were interesting and helped me learn something new along the way. When I found out that the current <em>This American Life</em> episode could be downloaded from their website for free, I knew it was time to write some code and automate this shit. Ruby to the rescue!</P>

  <p>My first attempt at all this was a simple little Ruby on Rails application, with an <code>/import</code> end-point that would check the .org and see if new episodes were available. If so, it would use <a href="https://nokogiri.org">Nokogiri</a> to scrape out the necessary meta data (number, title, description, date, image url, mp3 url) and save it all to a database, then use the image and mp3 urls to save copies of those files in an s3 bucket. I snagged this sick domain, and I was GOOD TO GO!</p>

  <p>The problem is, website scraping is notoriously unreliable, design elements change, paths break, and I eventually got sick of dealing with the little bugs that I couldn't figure out. The project went to the backburner and then eventually I let the domain expire. No big deal. Moving on.</p>

  <p>But recently I have been enjoying the process of moving some of my small database-driven websites over to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>! I've been using it for years for my <a href="https://hotwontquit.com" target="_blank">band</a> and <a href="https://secretrollerdisco.org" target="_blank">the roller disco in town</a>, but it's been fun translating everything over to static site generation. Like, this frickin' thing has <em>pagination</em> and a pretty good little <em>search bar</em>, and it's all achieved with some of the basic built-in functionality. Very cool. BIG FAN.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, I do miss out on some of the dynamic and automated aspects of the db-driven site. This is a much more manual process, but I think it's still less work in the end. Also, it's free. ;)</p>

  <a id="api"></a>

  <h3>There's an API?!</h3>

  <p>I use the label "API" very loosely here. I think more accurately this section should probably be called "End-Point" because that's all you get: one dumb end-point.</p>

  "why": "so that array[1] will return episode 1, array[2] returns episode 2, etc"
},{

},...]
  </pre>

  <p><a href="/api.json" target="_blank">{{ site.url }}/api.json</a></p>

  <p>It's literally just every episode in one big dumb dump, but it <em>is</em> valid json and can be parsed as such. Eventually, I want to add a couple url params for search, pagination, and probably single episodes. We'll see. Turns out, I think this shit is fun. What a world!</p>

  <p>Hope you enjoy,</p>
