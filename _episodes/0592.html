title: Are We There Yet?
description: >
  A bunch of us from our show went to refugee camps all over Greece. We found people falling in love, kids mad at their parents for dragging them to Europe, women doing their laundry in a baseball stadium locker room, hundreds of people living at a gas station, sitting next to the pumps, smoking, and a guy running what amounts to a cigarette charity. Also: wild pigs. 57,000 refugees are stuck in Greece, making homes in some surprising locations. We hear what thatâ€™s really like. INTERACTIVE TOUR
