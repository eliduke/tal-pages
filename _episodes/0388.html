description: >
  Nine radio producers. Two days. One rest stop on the New York State Thruway. In this show, we'll bring you stories of people who are just passing through, and people who are at the rest stop every dayâ€”working. One of them has worked there since 1969. A bunch of others came from Asia and eastern Europe to pour coffee for travelers.
