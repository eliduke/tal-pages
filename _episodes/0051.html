title: Animals Die, People Ponder
description: >
  Stories of people who handle dead animals. Don't worry â€” it's not as gross as it sounds. In fact, not disgusting at all. A story by George Saunders about an animal control man who falls in unrequited love. A woman who studies illuminated manuscripts, whose pages look like paper but are in fact animals. And other stories.
