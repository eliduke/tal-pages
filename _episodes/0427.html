description: >
  The formula for Coca-Cola  is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. Locked in a vault in Atlanta.  Supposedly unreplicable.  But we think we may have found the original recipe.  And to see if the formula actually might be Coke, we made a batch.  Or, anyway, we asked the folks at Jones Soda and Sovereign Flavors to whip up some up, to see if it tastes like Coke. The recipe is here.
