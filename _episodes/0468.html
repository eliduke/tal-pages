title: Switcheroo
description: >
  People pretending to be people they're not: sometimes it's harmless, sometimes it's harmful and sometimes it's hard to tell.  From world-famous artists to mail-order brides to a practice that could change the face of American journalism.  And BTW if a woman has approached you at a Cindy Sherman exhibit claiming to be Cindy Sherman, email us at web@thislife.org.
