title: When Patents Attack... Part Two!
description: >
  Two years ago, we did a program about a mysterious business in Texas that threatens companies with lawsuits for violating its patents. But the world of patent lawsuits is so secretive, there were basic questions we could not answer. Now we can.  And we get a glimpse why people say our patent system may be discouraging, not encouraging, innovation.
