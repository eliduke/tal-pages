title: The Night In Question
description: >
  Twenty years ago, the prime minister of Israel was assassinated. The killer was a lone gunman, Israeli and Jewish, just like the prime minister. Lots of witnesses saw it happen; the assassin confessed immediately, that night, and has never recanted. But today, oddly, lots of people donâ€™t believe it happened that way. And a question hangs over the country: did this act change the fate of the nation?
