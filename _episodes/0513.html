title: 129 Cars
description: >
  We spend a month at a Jeep dealership on Long Island as they try to make their monthly sales goal: 129 cars. If they make it, they'll get a huge bonus from the manufacturer, possibly as high as $85,000 â€” enough to put them in the black for the month. If they don't make it, it'll be the second month in a row. So they pull out all the stops. Photo gallery here.  NOTE: the Internet version of this episode includes un-bleeped curse words. Bleeped version here.
