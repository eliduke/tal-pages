title: Where Words Fail
description: >
  One reason we tell stories is to explain things to ourselves that cannot, in the end, always be explained. When someone we're close to dies, we struggle for a way to get our minds around the fact of their absence. And oftenâ€”the stories we invent aren't quite up to the job. In this week's show, people struggle to invent words adequate to cope with death.
