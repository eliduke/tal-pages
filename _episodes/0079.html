title: Stuck in the Wrong Decade
description: >
  People stuck in the wrong decade â€” or simply carrying a lot of the props from another decade. NOTE: This episode originally included a story by reporter Stephen Glass (no relation to Ira), which we have removed because of questions about its truthfulness. This story is included in the transcript only for reference.
