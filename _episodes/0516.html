title: Stuck In The Middle
description: >
  Jan Brady is not the only one who hated being in the middle. This week we have stories about how it sucks to be in limbo or be the mediator, but we also hear from a man who absolutely loves being in that uncertain and boring middle most of us dread â€” on hold, listening to hold music.
